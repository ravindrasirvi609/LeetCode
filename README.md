# LeetCode Problem Solving

This repository is for solving LeetCode problems and sharing daily questions. My goal is to improve my coding skills and provide a resource for others to practice problem-solving.

## How to Use

To use this repository, simply clone the project to your local machine. Each day, I will upload a new LeetCode question to the `daily_questions` folder. You can access the problem description and test cases in the corresponding subfolder. 

To submit your solution, create a new file in the `solutions` folder with the problem number and your username (e.g. `001_two_sum_john.java`). Then, write your solution in the file and submit a pull request.

## Daily Questions

Here's the list of daily LeetCode questions I plan to share:

- Day 1: Median of Two Sorted Arrays
- Day 2: Reverse Integer
- Day 3: Roman to Integer
- Day 4: Valid Parentheses
- Day 5: Merge Two Sorted Lists

Each daily question will be posted in the `daily_questions` folder, along with a README file that explains the problem and provides test cases.

## Code Style

I will be following Java coding conventions and using a consistent coding style throughout the project. Please follow the same style if you contribute to the project.
